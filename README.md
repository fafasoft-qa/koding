# koding
koding shortcuts nightwatch

I ran this test successfully after installing nightwatchjs with the following command: 

node nightwatch.js -t examples/tests/koding.js

Note: I could not make this script for coffeescript because I found it pretty difficult and there is no much support for that language for nightwatch on the web. See this for more info:
